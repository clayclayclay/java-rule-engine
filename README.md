## FIRST

The project provides the rule mapping service.

What is rule mapping service? 

Rule mapping service calculates results (such as the discount, warranty period etc.) based on rules provided by a merchant.

Why I do the work?

Because my company needs some support about this aspect. So I searched many information on the net,  did it myself.

it's my little process and I'm willing to share it with you.

## SECOND

The project is based maven, Spring Boot framework, with the MariaDB (same as MysqlDB)

The design about databse is shown below.

## THIRD

Because my project has limitations such as the low expansibility, it would be preffered if your business scenario is simple or for test purposes.

Now I'm in the reconstitution, and will soon push my next version.
